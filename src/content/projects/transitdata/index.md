Transitdata system will poll updates regarding departures and arrivals from Pubtrans database and convert them to [GTFS-RT](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/reference/) messages. GTFS-RT messages will then be published via MQTT broker.

<!-- create GTFS Realtime messages from PubTrans databases (also Apache Pulsar testbed) -->
