Transitlog enables visual exploration of observed public transport and how it compares to the intended traffic. The time scale is from years past until right now. The focus is on the movement of individual vehicles.

The initial users will be HSL customer service, traffic reimbursement with public transport operators and traffic planners.

<!-- visualize observed movement of individual vehicles (also Apache Pulsar testbed) -->
